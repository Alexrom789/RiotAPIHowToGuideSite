          This is a simple guide on how to use Riot Games' "League of Legends" related APIs.
          This guide is meant for those who have a little bit of experience with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, thus may not be suitible for more advaced programmers or those just starting off.

        <h2>
          What is an API? </h2>
           <p>An API or "Application Program Interface" is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications a developer can request and recive back from a server. Simply put, APIs are a way for developers to use exsisting code from another company and use it to enhance their applications by retrieving related data using the code. For example, a developer creating a weather app may already have working code and a graphical user interfeace but needs a way of reciving the weather data for his app to be fully functional. Enter the API. Using the API this developer can send request to a website like openweathermap.org which stores all the current weather information in their databases and retrieve this information for use in his/her app. You ca also think of an API as a library similar to the ones you import when programming in a language such as C++, Java, etc.</p>

        <h2>
          What about Riot Games' API?
        </h2>
        <p>Riot Games is the company behind one of the most played online video games, "League of Legends" or LoL for short.LoL is a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game in which 10 players known as "summoners" battle in teams of 5 in tournament style ranked games using champions or special heroes with different abilities. Because of this <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/">Riot Games API</a> deals largely with getting information about summoners, ranked statistics, recent game information and much more related to LoL.
          This site is meant as a guide to help you get familiar with and learn to use Riot Games API for League of Legends. 
        </p>

        <h2>
          A note on JSON.
        </h2>
        <p> In the world of APIs data is often sent and recived in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and basically its just how JavaScript formats its objects. This guide will assume you already are comfortable enough with JavaScript objects to follow along. We will cover some ways to manipulate JSON for API use later in this guide.
